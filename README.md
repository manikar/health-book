# Health Book
Health Book is a free and non-profitable app designed to support and empower patients along their cancer journey. Health Book is a refreshing change from apps that offer clinical resources and medical information. Health Book is created as a useful app to support patients wellbeing and help them manage their routine. An easy-to-use app that will reduce unnecessary stress during stressful times. This app helps manage personal information, appointments, contacts, notes, medicines, mood, body temprature, fluid intake, oxygen level and lists. 

**This app was developed as part of a Hackathon organized by IBM CIC Ballarat in collaboration with GICS (Grampians Integrated Cancer Services) in July 2019.**
